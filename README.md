# My Portfolio

## Description
 I have created my own portfolio using CSS. The task was challenging but in the end, I felt good with what I accomplished. For those that are reviewing my portfolio, I hope that you are inspired and encouraged after getting to know me and seeing all that I have created.

## Usage
I've created this portfolio so that anyone, anywhere would be able to see my work and be able to contact me with any questions or concerns.

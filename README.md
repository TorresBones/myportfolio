# My Portfolio

## Description
In this work I have created my own portfolio using CSS, it was challenging and fun at the same time but at the end I feel good with what I've accomplished, you that are visiting my portfolio I hope that you have a good time reading about me, seeing my  different type of projects and reading my codes.

## Usage
I've created this portfolio so different coders would of known me better and contact me with any questions or concerns.
